// Description: The Core Model defines basic management concepts 
//              such as ManagedElements, Systems, Services, Collections
//              and StatisticalInformation.  Its classes form the
//              top of the CIM object hierarchy.
//
//              The object classes below are listed in an order that
//              avoids forward references. Required objects, defined 
//              by other working groups, are omitted.
