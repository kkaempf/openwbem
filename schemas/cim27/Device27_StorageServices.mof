//              a model for storage services.
//
//              The object classes below are listed in an order that
//              avoids forward references. Required objects, defined 
//              by other working groups, are omitted.
// ==================================================================
// Change Log for v2.7
// CR775 - Add StorageSetting, StoragePool, StorageCapabilities,
//         StorageConfigurationService, StorageSettingsWithHints,
//         HostedStoragePool, and AllocatedStoragePool
// CR759 - Add ConfigurationReportingService
// CR777 - Add StorageSynchrononized 
//         Add StorageSetting.DeltaReservation, 
//         StorageCpabilities.DeltaReservationMin, 
//         StorageCpabilities.DeltaReservationMax, 
//         StorageCpabilities.DeltaReservationDefault, 
//         StorageConfigurationService.CreateReplica() and 
//         StorageConfigurationService.ModifySynchronization()
