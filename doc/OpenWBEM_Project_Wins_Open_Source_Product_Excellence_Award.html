<p><i>Award Recognizes Best Open Source Project at LinuxWorld Expo, New

</p>
<p><b>OREM, Utah--Feb. 4, 2002--</b>Caldera International, Inc.
(Nasdaq: CALD) today announced that the OpenWBEM project, an effort to
develop an Open Source implementation of Web Based Enterprise
Management (WBEM) suitable for commercial and non-commercial use,
claimed the Best Open Source Project Award at LinuxWorld Expo, New
York. Caldera is the OpenWBEM project maintainer and contributor of the
original code base.
</p>
<p>"Caldera is honored to receive this recognition for the
OpenWBEM project," said Drew Spencer, chief technology officer for
Caldera International, Inc. "Since its inception, Caldera has remained
committed to the Open Source community. Our objective with OpenWBEM,
comparable to our intent with Caldera Volution Manager, is to make it
easier for system administrators to manage heterogeneous systems." </p>
<p>Started at Caldera, the OpenWBEM project is an implementation
of the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) WBEM standard. In
essence, the OpenWBEM project creates a port through which standardized
management of various computing systems is possible. The current
version is completely usable, and the goal now is to port it to many
platforms and to write providers. </p>
