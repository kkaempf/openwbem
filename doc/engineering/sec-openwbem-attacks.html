<h1>Possible Attacks Against OpenWBEM</h1>

<h2>Attack point: inter-process communication between OpenWBEM processes</h2>

<p>
Note: Every OpenWBEM subsystem process is a descendant of the OpenWBEM Monitor
process.  Communication between an OpenWBEM subsystem and the Monitor occurs
only through an anonymous Unix-domain socket pair that the Monitor creates.
The monitor only accepts requests from such sockets associated with a child it
has created, and thereby identifies the entity making the request.
</p>

<p>A. Attack: Obtain a capability from the monitor by impersonating another
user/role.</p>
<ol>
<li>Obtain socket descriptor held by existing subsystem for communicating with
   monitor.
  <ol>
  <li> Cause existing subsystem process to run attacker's code.
    <ol>
    <li> Run as root.
    <li> Run as same user as subsystem process to alter memory image.
    <li> Compromise through inputs.
    </ol>
  </ol>

<li>Alter memory image of monitor.
  <ol>
  <li> Run as root.
  <li> Compromise through inputs.
  </ol>
</ol>

<p>Defenses:</p>
<ul>
<li> Be very stingy in handing out capabilities.  When deciding whether a userid
should be allowed a capability, consider whether that user should be entrusted
with arbitrary use of that capability (not just in the manner it is used in
the OpenWBEM code.)  Only hand out capabilities to a small set of system
userids.

<li> Supply and enforce narrow limits on the arguments allowed when requesting
capabilities.

<li> Have OpenWBEM code request capabilities in fixed patterns so that the
Monitor can easily detect any deviation from the expected pattern.
</ul>


<p>B. Attack: Intercept a capability passed to a subsystem process.</p>
<ol>
<li> Obtain descriptor for capability after it is received by intended recipient
     process.
  <ol>
  <li> Cause subsystem process to run attackers code. (See A.)
  </ol>
<li> Obtain descriptor for capability from Monitor.
  <ol>
  <li> Cause monitor to run attacker's code.  (See A.)
  </ol>
</ol>

<p>Defenses: Same as A.</p>


<p>C. Attack: Request an operation from a "server" subsystem process by
impersonating another ("client") subsystem process.</p>
<ol>
<li> Obtain socket descriptor held by client subsystem for communicating with
   server subsystem.
  <ol>
  <li> Cause client subsystem process to run attacker's code.
    <ol>
    <li> Run as root.
    <li> Run as same user as client subsystem process to alter memory image.
    <li> Compromise through inputs.
    </ol>
  </ol>
<li> Alter memory image of server subsystem.
  <ol>
  <li> Run as root.
  <li> Run as same user as server subsystem process.
  <li> Compromise through inputs.
  </ol>
</ol>

<p>Defenses: Protect passwords / authentication info for OpenWBEM subsystem user
accounts.</p>

<p>Final note: no subsystem should assume that messages received from another
subsystem are properly formed; this should always be checked.</p>

<h2>Attack point: various files</h2>

<p>The following files control the behavior of OpenWBEM:</p>
<ul>
<li> Configuration files.
<li> Provider shared libraries.
<li> Provider programs (for providers run out-of-process).
<li> Repository files.
<li> Monitor's ACL file.
</ul>

<p>Attack: modify file.</p>

<p>Attack: Delete file.</p>

<p>Attack: Create file that previously did not exist.</p>

<p>Attack: delete empty directory that is searched for a file and re-create
with attacker having write permissions.</p>

<p>Defenses:</p>
<ul>
<li> Use most restrictive file permissions possible.
<li> Store files only in secured directories: every ancestor directory must be
writable only by root and the appropriate userid.
<li> Have a small, fixed set of places where these files may be installed, to
ease enforcement of permissions.
<li> Preferentially use calls that deal with file descriptors instead of file
paths, to avoid time-of-check/time-of-use race conditions.
<li> Use secure file opening procedure to avoid race conditions (see BSS).
<li> Check file and directory ownership, group membership, and permissions
before reading/loading; if these are incorrect, fail.
<li> Never scan a directory for files to process everything found therein.
For example, don't load a shared lib found in a provider directory unless
you already expected to find that specific shared library there.
<li> Check modification / creation times against expected values?
</ul>


<h2>Attack point: system resources read by providers</h2>

<p>Defense: Take care that any provider that has to parse or process external
data sources never assumes that this data will be in the correct format or
satisfy any reasonable limits.</p>


<h2>Attack point: export of indications from IS to client</h2>

<p>Require authentication of destination.</p>
