  <title>OpenWBEM Binary Compatibility</title>

<body>
<h1>Binary compatibility</h1>
<br>
We will not worry about maintaining binary compatibility with the
client APIs between different versions of OW, since it is trivial to
solve the problem by installing 2 or more different versions of the
client libraries. This is just an issue for package developers to
provide some way for multiple versions of the client libraries to be
installed simultaneously.&nbsp; Note that we do try hard to maintain
source compatibility for client applications, if at all possible we
mark interfaces as deprecated when a replacement has been created. They
are deprecated for at least one release and then removed after client
applications have had a chance to migrate.<br>
<br>
Likewise, we will not worry about internal server components (such as
Services, provider interfaces, request handlers, etc) since these are
mostly provided with OW and there aren't a lot of people developing
them (the one exception being Jason Long's owperl provider interface.)<br>
<br>
What we do need to worry about are providers, since there can only be
one version of the cimom running and listening on port 5988. Granted,
you could run multiple cimoms as long as they are not trying to listen
on the same port or use the same repository, but that is a waste or
resources and they are essentially invisible to the external
world.&nbsp; The goal is to allow multiple sets of providers (possibly
from different sources or products) to all coexist in the "official"
system cimom, and to ensure that all future installed versions of the
cimom can be installed and correctly use the providers. Note that we
will only support this for providers which follow the rules we
establish. If a provider doesn't follow the rules, there will be no
guarantee.<br>
<br>
The purpose of this document is to explore various ways to achieve the
goal of allowing multiple sets of providers (some build against older
versions of OW) to coexist.<br>
<br>
<h2>Out of process</h2>
Use the remote provider interface and provider agent (or similar items)
to talk to providers that are out of the cimom's process.<br>
<br>
Advantages:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Functionality to do this is already implemented, and so it's
possible to do this now without any additional work.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
Disadvantages:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<ul>
  <li>Uses more memory. Additional process(es) hosting the providers
have to be running.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Slower. Serializing the CIM objects and WBEM calls for IPC isn't
free.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Harder to configure. Setting up the cimom&lt;-&gt;provider agent
communication and initialization is extra work.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Less reliable. More components and communication links provide
additional points of failure.<br>
  </li>
  <li>More packaging work for provider suppliers, since each product
needs to provide their own binary compatible "provider agent"</li>
  <li>No support for indication, polled, or indication export providers.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Maintain binary compatibility for all OW code</h2>
To do this we will have to adopt a strict set of rules about what we
can change in the code.&nbsp; To allow for a bit more flexibility (e.g.
adding a new data member) all classes will need to be converted to use
the pimpl idiom.<br>
<br>
Advantages:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Providers may use any of the classes available.</li>
</ul>
Disadvantages:<br>
<ul>
  <li>This will take a lot of work to implement. All classes will have
to be converted to use the pimpl idiom or else have their data members
frozen for all eternity.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Very restricted in refactorings that we could do. Changing class
names, function signatures and inheritance hierarchies will be
impossible. Other changes will be limited.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Higher maintenance effort.&nbsp; Constant vigilance of the binary
API will have to be done. Changes will have to follow the binary api
rules, which will take more work than otherwise.<br>
  </li>
  <li>New features which need new functionality not possible with the
present APIs may have to invent a similar/second/duplicate API so as to
not change the original.</li>
  <li>Overall performance decrease (possibly noticable) because of
switching classes to use pimpl idiom &amp; non-inline functions.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Maintain binary compatibility only for a new provider interface</h2>
The idea behind this is to create a new C++ provider interface which
will provide all the functionality a provider needs. Providers that
only use symbols from the provider interface will work with any future
version of OW.&nbsp; A provider should not use any classes/functions
outside of the provider interface. The strict binary compatibility
rules will be applied only to the provider interface.<br>
<br>
Advantages:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Maintain freedom to refactor most OW code.</li>
  <li>Good separation of the Provider API from the rest of the code.</li>
  <li>Easy and fast to initially implement.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Disadvantages:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Duplication. Many of the classes in the common library will have
to be duplicated. We could use some techniques to reduce the
duplication, but that takes more up front effort, and may be less
efficient.</li>
  <li>Performance hit in translating to/from the provider APIs vs
current method.</li>
  <li>Future maintenance overhead needed for factoring out the
commonalities between the new interface and the internal classes, in
order to reduce the footprint of OpenWBEM, and increase reliability
(shared code is more frequently exercised code, and has its bugs shaken
out faster), and reduce future development effort (changes can be made
in one place instead of two).<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>CMPI</h2>
CMPI is a C provider API invented by IBM that is being standardized by
the OpenGroup. The API should be stable and maintain backward
compatibility.<br>
<br>
Advantages:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Binary compatibility across different cimoms (including different
versions of OW).</li>
  <li>Exists today and so would require no work to begin using it.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Disadvantages:<br>
<ul>
  <li>No support for secondary instance, indication, polled, or
indication export providers.</li>
  <li>The CMPI interface is all C, and thus is difficult and error
prone to use.</li>
  <li>The CMPI provider interface implementation is not well
maintained, and has had numerous bugs.</li>
  <li>CMPI has been designed with garbage collection in mind, and so
has no provision for providers to free temporary objects they have
created. They are all freed after the provider is finished and returns.
This can lead to a large memory footprint if the provider returns a
large number of instances. The native providers don't suffer from this
problem.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
