</H1>
<H1 CLASS="western">1. OpenWBEM Overview &amp; Concepts</H1>
<H2 CLASS="western">Genesis</H2>
<P>OpenWBEM was started at Caldera in early 2001. It was intended to
become part of the Volution Manager product.  It was open sourced in
the desire to help increase the compatiblity of management products,
especially for Linux. It is now maintained by a variety of various
companies and individuals.  Dan Nuffer is the project lead.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Overview</H2>
<P>OpenWBEM is a software suite that is a mature implementation of
the DMTF CIM and WBEM standards. Components include a CIM Object
Manager (CIMOM), a CIM Client API, a CIM Listener API, a WBEM Query
Language (WQL) engine.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Features</H2>
<P>See openwbem.org for a nice list.</P>
<H1 CLASS="western">2. Installation</H1>
<H2 CLASS="western">Pre-Requisites</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P>OpenWBEM is written in C++, and has been developed on gcc. 
	It also can be compiled by most current C++ compilers, include
	Microsoft Visual C++ 7.1, IBM's VisualAge for C++, and HP's aC++</P>
	<LI><P>pthreads.</P>
</UL>
<H2 CLASS="western">Optional Feature Pre-Requisites</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P>flex – Only if you obtained the source from CVS, or if you
	need to modify the mof or wql lexers.</P>
	<LI><P>bison – Only if you obtained the source from CVS, or if you
	need to modify the mof or wql parsers.</P>
	<LI><P>perl with embedding headers and libraries – If you want to
	use the perl provider interface.</P>
	<LI><P>PAM libraries – If you want to use the PAM authentication
	module.  These are part of glibc on Linux.  
	</P>
	<LI><P>PAM development headers – If you want to build the PAM
	authentication module.</P>
	<LI><P>zlib – If you want to enable &amp; use http compression.</P>
	<LI><P>slp (e.g. OpenSLP) – If you want to use the slp provider to
	advertise or the client api to discover slp cimom advertisements.</P>
	<LI><P>openssl – If you want to use https.</P>
</UL>
<H2 CLASS="western">The Installation</H2>
<P>First download and extract the OpenWBEM source code.  Then run the
configure script: <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">./configure</FONT> 
There are quite a few options you can pass to the configure script
that are used to enable/disable certain optional features, or to tell
it where to find headers and libraries if they aren't in the standard
locations.  Use the --<FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">help</FONT>
flag to get a list of the options.  If you are building a copy to do
development work, it is highly recommended you use the
<FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">–enable-debug-mode</FONT> option. 
After configure is finished, you can run <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">make</FONT>
to build.  Verify that everything is working, and run <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">make
check</FONT>.  Run <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">make install</FONT>
to install OpenWBEM on your system.  Having it installed is not
required, but will make it easier to use since the binaries and
libraries will be in the <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">PATH</FONT>.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>There is also an RPM spec file available.  You can build OpenWBEM
by executing: <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">rpmbuild -ta
openwbem-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz</FONT>.  This will generate an
openwbem and openwbem-devel rpm. You can then install them by running
<FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">rpm -i &lt;rpm filename&gt;</FONT>. 
The RPM provides some additional files that aren't installed
otherwise on Linux.  These include the init script
(<FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">/etc/init.d/owcimomd</FONT>), the
PAM configuration file (<FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">/etc/pam.d/openwbem</FONT>),
and some miscellaneous documentation.</P>
<H1 CLASS="western">3. Configuration</H1>
<P>The OpenWBEM cimom (owcimomd) can be passed 3 different command
line arguments.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>-h prints the help.  
	</P>
	<LI><P>-d tells owcimomd to run in debug mode.  This causes it to
	<B>not</B> fork into the background and detach from the terminal
	(daemonizing).  It will also print all log messages in addition to
	whatever logger is configured.</P>
	<LI><P>-c &lt;config filename&gt; specifies which config file to
	use.  By default owcimomd will use the config file in
	<FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">${sysconfdir}/openwbem/openwbem.conf</FONT>
	. <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">${sysconfdir}</FONT> defaults to
	<FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">/usr/local/etc</FONT>, but can be
	changed by telling the configure script to use a different prefix or
	sysconfdir (e.g. <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">--sysconfdir=/etc</FONT>).
	This option allows the user to override the default and manually
	specify the config file to use.</P>
</UL>
<P>The owcimomd config file contains many options which can be used
to modify it's behavior.  Most are set to reasonable defaults.  You
probably won't need to change any of the options that refer to
directories.  Some you may wish to configure are those related to
authorization, logging, or optional features.  The config file
contains explanations for all available options.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Configuring authentication</H2>
<P>Currently there are 3 authentication methods.  PAM, Simple, and
Digest.  OpenWBEM also supports custom authentication modules.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">PAM</H3>
<P>This method uses the PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) system
api.  This means that the cimom will use the system's authentication.
 The client will have to use the same username and password they
would use to log in.  To use this:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Set the <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">owcimomd.authentication_module</FONT>
	config item to point to the <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">libpamauthentication.so</FONT>
	library file.  
	</P>
	<LI><P>Set the <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">pam.allowed_users</FONT>
	config item to a space delimited list of the users who are allowed
	to access the cimom. To allow all users, put in <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">*</FONT>.</P>
	<LI><P>Install the openwbem PAM config file.  Copy
	<FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">etc/pam.d/openwbem</FONT> to
	<FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">/etc/pam.d/</FONT></P>
</UL>
<P>To build the PAM authentication module, you must have the PAM
development headers installed.  They are not installed by default in
many versions of Linux.  If you find that the <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">libpamauthentication.so</FONT>
file was not built, this is because the OpenWBEM configure script
will automatically detect if the PAM headers are there or not, and
only build the PAM authentication module if they are installed.  If
you find this happened to you, and you want to remedy the situation,
install the headers (commonly in an RPM called pam-devel), then
remove the <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">config.cache</FONT> file
generated by the configure script, and then re-run configure and
rebuild.</P>
<P>When using PAM, the http simple authentication headers are used,
meaning the password is sent in an insecure fashion over the wire. 
To prevent sniffers on the Internet from obtaining your credentials
you must use SSL together with the PAM authentication module.  This
may not be a concern in a trusted environment.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Simple</H3>
<P>The simple authentication module is backed by a file where each
line contains a user name and password separated by a colon. <BR><BR>An
example file is like this:</P>
<P> <BR><FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">username1:password1
<BR>username2:password2</FONT></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>To use this, set the <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">owcimomd.authentication_module</FONT>
config item to point to the <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">libsimpleauthentication.so</FONT>
library file.  Set the <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">simple_auth.password_file</FONT>
config item to point to the password file you have created.</P>
<P>When using the simple authentication method, the http simple
authentication headers are used, meaning the password is sent in an
insecure fashion over the wire.  To prevent sniffers on the Internet
from obtaining your credentials you must use SSL together with the
simple authentication module.  This may not be a concern in a trusted
environment.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Digest</H3>
<P>The digest authentication mechanism is built into the http server,
and bypasses the normal openwbem authentication module.  To turn on
digest authentication, set the <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">http_server.use_digest</FONT>
config item to true.  Digest uses cryptographic hashing and other
mechanisms to prevent discovery of passwords.  Because of this, it
cannot integrate with system passwords. The digest authentication
module requires you create a password file using the <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">owdigestgenpass</FONT>
utility.  Here is an example of how to use it:</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">owdigestgenpass -l user1 -f
/the/password/file</FONT></P>
<P>Enter the password when prompted.  If you aren't running it on the
same computer as the cimom, you can also use the -h flag to specify
the cimom computer's hostname. To inform openwbem of the digest
password file, set the <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">http_server.digest_password_file</FONT>
config item.</P>
<P>Digest authentication is safe to use over an unencrypted (non-SSL)
connection.  Attackers will be unable to obtain the password or do a
replay attack.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Custom</H3>
<P>Create a class that implements the AuthenticatorIFC interface and
compile it into a shared library.  Point the config file at it and
you're done.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">SSL</H3>
<P>OpenWBEM will build in SSL client and server support if the
configure scripts finds the openssl development headers and
libraries.  The <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">http_server.https_port</FONT>
config item specifies which port the https server will listen on.  If
set to -1, https will be disabled.  If not specified, the default is
port 5989 which is the IANA assigned port for CIM-XML over https.</P>
<P>To use SSL you need to setup a SSL host key and certificate. If
you are just testing, or doing development, you can use the test file
the comes with OpenWBEM: <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">test/acceptance/testfiles/hostkey+cert.pem</FONT>
<BR><BR>Otherwise you can generate your own using a SSL key and
certificate tool such as openssl, or even get one signed by a
recognized certificate authority (e.g. Verisign).  The file has to
contain both the server key and certificate in pem format.</P>
<P>You may want to use the provided <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">owgencert</FONT>
script to create a self signed certificate and key.  <BR><BR>Make
sure the config item <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">http_server.SSL_cert</FONT>
points to the file.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western">4. Execution</H1>
<P>During development I almost always run owcimomd in debug mode (use
the -d command line argument).  In production, it should be run as a
normal system daemon.  There is a Linux init script available
(<FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">etc/init/owcimomd</FONT>) which
works on most Linux distributions.  The init script assumes openwbem
has been <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">./configure</FONT>'d with
the following arguments: <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">--prefix=/usr
--sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var/lib</FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Create Namespace(s)</H2>
<P>owcimomd always has a namespace named <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">root</FONT>.
 OpenWBEM supports a<SPAN LANG="en-US"> hierarchical </SPAN>view of
namespaces, using the <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">__Namespace</FONT>
class.  The DMTF has deprecated <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">__Namespace</FONT>
in lieu of <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">CIM_Namespace</FONT>. 
OpenWBEM supports  <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">CIM_Namespace</FONT>
if the class has been created, and it provides a flat view of
namespaces. Enumerating instances of the class will return an
instance for each namespace in the cimom.  The CIM Operations over
HTTP spec recommends that <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">CIM_Namespace</FONT>
always be available in the <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">root</FONT>
namespace.  It is common practice to use <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">root/cimv2</FONT>
as the namespace to hold version 2 of the CIM schema.  You can create
namespaces using any CIM client such as the SNIA browser.  OpenWBEM
provides a utility named <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">owcreatenamespace</FONT>
which can create a namespace.  Here is an example of how to create
the <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">root/cimv2</FONT> namespace on
the cimom running on the same machine: 
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">owcreatenamespace
http://localhost/cimom root/cimv2</FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Import Schema(s)</H2>
<P>You use <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">owmofc</FONT> to import
mof classes and instances into the cimom.  
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>It is recommended that the CIM_Interop schema be present in the
<FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">root</FONT> namespace.  Run the
following commands to accomplish this:</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">owmofc -u http://localhost/cimom
-n root CIM_Core28.mof</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">owmofc -u http://localhost/cimom
-n root CIM_Event28.mof</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">owmofc -u http://localhost/cimom
-n root CIM_Interop28.mof</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">owmofc -u http://localhost/cimom
-n root OpenWBEM_Interop.mof</FONT></P>
<P>As of this writing the current version of the schema is 2.8. 
Substitute the version of the schema that you wish to use in the
above commands.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>For all versions of OpenWBEM:</P>
<P>You will have to import the schema into the namespace you wish to
use (<FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">root/cimv2</FONT> is
recommended):</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">owmofc -u http://localhost/cimom
-n root/cimv2 CIM_Schema28.mof</FONT></P>
<P>Substitute the actual schema file you are using.  OpenWBEM 3.0.x
comes with the CIM 2.8 schema in the schemas/cim28 directory.  Other
versions can be downloaded from the DMTF at
http://dmtf.org/standards/standard_cim.php.</P>
<P>If you wish to use ACLs, create the <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">root/security</FONT>
namespace and import <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">OpenWBEM_Acl1.0.mof</FONT>.
 Refer to the ACL.HOWTO file if you want more information about ACLs.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Install Providers</H2>
<H3 CLASS="western">Automatic Provider Registration</H3>
<P>When OpenWBEM starts up, it will scan and load all provider
interfaces.  Each provider interface is given the opportunity to
automatically register any class/provider combos that its responsible
for with the provider manager.  Thus this behavior is dependent on
the provider interface.  The C++ provider interface will scan all
providers at start-up. It is currently not possible to dynamically
register a provider that uses this registration scheme.  The cimom
has to be restarted when one is added or removed.  It is not
necessary to create any special classes or instances to inform the
cimom of the provider, since it will be found when the cimom starts
up.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Provider Qualifier</H3>
<P>OpenWBEM has support for the provider qualifier and will continue
to support the provider qualifier as long as people still use it.</P>
<P>To use the provider qualifier, you should first find the class in
the CIM schema that most closely resembles what you want to model. 
Then you create a subclass for your object.  You attach a provider
qualifier to the class that identifies your provider.  For instance:</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">[provider(“c++::acme_foo”)]</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">class ACME_Foo : CIM_Foo</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">{</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">};</FONT></P>
<P>tells the cimom to look for libacme_foo.so when it needs to query
the provider for the ACME_Foo class.  The value of the qualifier
<FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">“c++::acme_foo”</FONT> identifies
both the provider type and the provider library name.  <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">c++</FONT>
is the type, and <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">acme_foo</FONT> is
the name.  Other provider interfaces have a different type.  To
install the provider, simply copy the provider library to the
appropriate directory.  The config item <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">cppprovifc.prov_location</FONT>
specifies the directory.  It defaults to
<FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">/usr/local/lib/openwbem/c++providers</FONT>.
 Then import your mof into the cimom and your provider will be
available.  It is <B>not</B> necessary to restart the cimom.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Using CIM Clients</H3>
<P>OpenWBEM currently has utilities to:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>compile mof (owmofc)</P>

<H1 CLASS="western">5. Client API</H1>
<H2 CLASS="western">Overview</H2>
<P>OpenWBEM has all the necessary code to facilitate writing a CIM

utilities for sockets, threading, etc.  See the Doxygen generated API
docs if you need more information.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Building/Compiling/Linking</H2>
<P>The client API is broken up into various shared libraries to allow

</UL>
<H1 CLASS="western">6. Building Providers</H1>
<H2 CLASS="western">Overview</H2>
<H3 CLASS="western">Instance</H3>
<P>Instance providers are responsible for handling the following
intrinsic methods for a certain class:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>EnumerateInstanceNames</P>
	<LI><P>EnumerateInstances</P>
	<LI><P>GetInstance</P>
	<LI><P>CreateInstance</P>
	<LI><P>ModifyInstance</P>
	<LI><P>DeleteInstance</P>
</UL>
<P>Typically, each instance (uniquely identified by it's keys)
represents one object to be managed.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Secondary Instance</H3>
<P>Secondary Instance providers aren't responsible to exposing
instances like instance providers are, but they are given the
opportunity to filter instances returned by enumInstances() or
getInstance().  They also get notified on createInstance(),
modifyInstance() and deleteInstance().</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Associator</H3>
<P>Associator providers are responsible for handling the following
intrinsic methods for a certain association class:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Associators</P>
	<LI><P>AssociatorNames</P>
	<LI><P>References</P>
	<LI><P>ReferenceNames</P>
</UL>
<P>With OpenWBEM, an dynamic association can be implemented with just
an instance provider, but it can be much more efficient to implement
the associator provider interface.  Associator providers should also
be instance providers so that the instance functions will work for
the association class.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Method</H3>
<P>Method providers are responsible for handling any extrinsic
methods defined in a class.  It is common for an instance provider to
also be a method provider.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Indication</H3>
<P>Indication providers are responsible for generating indications.
There are two categories of indications, Life-cycle and alert.  See
the DMTF indication whitepaper for more info.  Life-cycle indications
are tied to a specific class, and so will usually be implemented as
an instance/indication provider.  OpenWBEM supports three models of
implementing indication providers:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Instance Life-cycle: polled by the cimom – This is the
	easiest to implement, but also is more cpu and memory intensive than
	the other alternatives.  The cimom keeps a cached copy of all the
	instances of the class and every polling cycle will get the current
	set.  The differences in the sets between the cycles drive the
	generation of indications.</P>
	<LI><P>Separate thread – This is good for the case when a separate
	thread can block on an external event (such as a socket or kernel
	semaphore, etc.) and raise an indication whenever something happens.</P>
	<LI><P>Polled provider – This is good for the case where the
	provider has to poll for data (e.g. Check the free disk space every
	30 seconds)</P>

approaches.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Provider Development Process</H2>
<H3 CLASS="western">Extend Schema</H3>
<P>The first step is to find the appropriate class in the standard
CIM schema that represents the element you want to model.  Next you
create a subclass for your object.  You can add properties and
methods that apply. Creating a subclass is done with mof (or you can
use the new rose plug-in available from the sblim project and
generate the mof).  The class may be dependent on others via
associations, so you may have multiple iterations of classes that
need to be instrumented.  If you implement non-association classes,
you also usually need to implement associations for them as well.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Use CodeGen</H3>
<P>Decide how much functionality your provider will need.  Is a
read-only instance provider good enough?  If you have methods you
need to implement, you will need to be an instance/method provider. 
If your class needs to be monitored for changes, you need to
implement the indication provider provider interface to send
indications.  Once you know what provider interfaces you'll need to
implement, you can select the appropriate CodeGen template, and then
generate stubs for your provider.  See the CodeGen README for more
information on how to use it.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Finish writing provider</H3>
<P>Now you get to do the real work, interface with whatever you're
modeling and convert it into CIM objects.  Link your provider into a
shared library and you're set.</P>
