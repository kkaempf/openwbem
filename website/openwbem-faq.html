<h3>What do I need to build OpenWBEM?</h3>
<blockquote>
To build OpenWBEM, you need gcc version 2.95 or higher,
and GNU makex. &nbsp;Note that
you currently can't use gcc 2.96 from RedHat, it miscompiles the
code.&nbsp; Also you can't use gcc 3.0.x due to some problems that gcc
3.0.x has
with iostreams. gcc 3.1.x and higher have been verified to work
correctly.&nbsp;
Optionally, you may also want
  <a href="http://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a> if you want to support
HTTPS, and <a href="http://www.gzip.org/zlib/">zlib</a> if you want to
support zlib (deflate) compression. </blockquote>

<h3>make check failed.&nbsp; What do I do now?</h3>
<blockquote>
If the acceptance test script failed, there are several log files
which may help you determine what went wrong. &nbsp;The acceptance
script installs OpenWBEM in test/acceptance/stage. &nbsp;The directory
test/acceptance/stage/results contains the output from the various
tests performed by the acceptance test script. &nbsp;You might start
with
owcimomd.output. &nbsp;You can also look in test/acceptance/stage for
core files. &nbsp;If you are familiar with gdb, please create a
backtrace
from the core file(s) and email it to <a
 href="mailto:openwbem-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">openwbem-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.

<h3>Why can't I authenticate using Linux-PAM authentication?</h3>
<blockquote>
Make sure you have a /etc/pam.d/openwbem file that works. &nbsp;You
should
be able to copy the one from etc/pam.d/ in the source tar file.
&nbsp;Also,
make sure you are authenticating as a user listed in the
pam.allowed_users
variable in openwbem.conf. &nbsp;For additional information, see the
file
AuthModule.HOWTO in the source tar file.

<h3>Why doesn't the configure script detect OpenSSL?</h3>
<blockquote>
The configure script will look in the following places the the OpenSSL
headers and libraries: <tt>/usr/local/openssl /usr/lib/openssl
/usr/local/ssl /usr/lib/ssl /usr/local /usr/pkg /opt /opt/openssl</tt>
If you have installed OpenSSL in another directory, then you must use
the --with-ssl-dir switch to specify the path to the OpenSSL
"installation", not the headers.
This should be the directory containing <tt>./include</tt> and <tt>./lib</tt>.
If you installed OpenSSL from the source tarball distribution, the
default location is <tt>/usr/local/ssl</tt>, and should be found
automatically.
  <br>
If OpenSSL is installed in one of the locations listed above, and the
configure script is not finding it, then most likely you don't have the
OpenSSL library directory in your <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>. If OpenSSL
is installed in <tt>/usr/local/ssl</tt>, then <tt>/usr/local/ssl/lib</tt>
must be in your <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>. configure tries to
compile and run a small ssl program. If the program doesn't run, then
the configure script will not detect OpenSSL.
With <tt>/usr/local/ssl/lib</tt> in your <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>,
the small test program should work, and configure will "find"
OpenSSL in <tt>/usr/local/ssl</tt> automatically.

<h3>How do I build from OpenWBEM from CVS?</h3>
<blockquote>
First run the cvsbootstrap.sh script, which will generate the
Makefile.in files and the configure script. You must have autoconf and
automake installed for this to work. Then you can run configure and
finally make.
