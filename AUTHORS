OpenWBEM Authors file
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I would imagine that a typical AUTHORS file would just contain a list of the
developers that pulled the whole thing together. I'm going to use it as a forum
for expressing my appreciation for all the hard work and diligence that has
been put in by the developers that put together the initial release of OpenWBEM.
Thanks to these guys, the initial release only took us about 3 months to put
together. I've been developing software now for about 15 years, and these 
people are some of the finest developers I've ever had the privilege of working
with.

            Thanks Guys!
