Testing:
    - smaller schema for make check.  create classes to exercise all aspects 
      of mof and xml.
    - bad xml tests
    - do some interop testing (client-server & server-client)
      - snia old and new (http://www.opengroup.org/snia-cimom/)
      - wbem services (get cimworkshop talking to owcimomd)
      - pegasus
      - openwbem 1.3.2 1.2.x (make sure binary fails)
      - wbemcli (http://www-124.ibm.com/sblim/sblimrm.html)
    - various make check components to have separate namespaces.
    - review CIM operations over HTTP v1.2 and see where we deviate.
    - Test case insensitivity (eg. try to add a disk and DISK class)
    - Test storing 1 million instances.
    - Test that failed OW_ASSERT(foo) comes across the wire correctly.
    - Capture XML and run it through xmllint with the dtd.
    - Create a test that does a createInstance with a class that has an 
      infinite number of properties (to try and simulate a DNS attack)
    - Cleanup/integrate some of the tests under src/*/test subdirs
    - Create a test for mof compiling directly to the repository.

Fix problems:
    - Man pages aren't getting included in the rpm.
    - Update the *.HOWTO files.
    - To avoid permanent deadlocks, change most locks to use a timeout.
      - If a timeout happens, certain places can retry the operation.
    - use DIST_SUBDIRS
    - Add an option to run as a different user and drop privelidges on startup.
    - Fix problems with OW_DateTime and OW_CIMDateTime
    - Have OW_HTTPClient report contents of CIMError header if present on an 
      HTTP error.
    - Implement a "compatibility mode" in the client if the server doesn't 
      support the latest version(s) of the spec(s).

New features:
    - Handle the various options in the CIM_IndicationSubscription and
      CIM_IndicationHandler classes.
    - Implement the CIM_Interop27 build-in providers.
      - CIM_CIMXMLCommunicationMechanism
      - OpenWBEM_BinaryCommunicationMechanism
      - CIM_CommMechanismForManager
      Optional:
      - CIM_ProtocolAdapter
      - CIM_CommMechanismForAdapter
      - CIM_SystemIdentification
      - CIM_SystemInNamespace
      - CIM_IdentificationOfManagedSystem
      - CIM_CIMOMStatisticalData
    - Update SLP provider to use the new standard template.
      - config item for interop namespace
    - Don't load the authentication provider if allow_anonymous is turned on.
    - client batch support
    - Add support for running under inetd
    - Add a function for providers to store/retrieve data(OW_Array<OW_UInt8>).
    - Create provider base classes which will make writing providers easier
      - Have the simple associator providers only have to
        implement references.  The base class can easily do the rest.
      - Template method base class for weak to ComputerSystem(anything?) providers (almost all hardware)
      - Use ideas from SBLIM: http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/oss/sblim/doc/ProviderArchitecture.pdf
    - Add log messages to the thread pool class so we can output
      information about threads starting and exiting.
    - create static CIMQualifiers for standard qualifiers.

Post 3.0
    - associators and references can't return an objectpath, only an instance.
      This won't support cross-cimom associations. Extend the interface to
      handle this. Maybe add the extra information to OW_CIMInstance, or create
      a new class to encapsulate an OW_CIMObjectPath and an OW_CIMInstance.
    - Refactor OW_CIMObjectPath into various classes which represent different
      usages of paths (e.g. ClassName, ModelPath, LocalPath, etc.)
    - Providers/Provider interfaces in a different process. Implement with 
      fork/exec/pipes for communication?
    - Internationalization.
    - Deal with locale on WBEM requests. (at least reject those that won't work)
      Look at unicode.org http://www.unicode.org/Public/ALPHA/CVTUTF-1-1/ConvertUTF.{c,h}
    - Add better error handling/messages to the MOF compiler.
    - Binary Indications (Possibly re-factor and use CIMXMLListener)
    - CMPI
    - Fix the lexer of the MOF compiler to parse unicode MOF files.  
        - Replace the input functions so that they translate from Unicode to
          UTF8, and fix the lexer to handle UTF8 strings and identifiers.
        - Or replace the lexer with something that can handle unicode,
          possibly the slex lexer from spirit.
    - Have an option for the mof compiler to parse a string.  Add interfaces
      such as OW_CIMQualifierType createQualifierType(const OW_String& qualMof)
      and OW_CIMClass createClass(const OW_String& clsMof) to the MOFCompiler
      class.
    - Use Boost.Python to create a python binding to the client library, to
      allow for easy scripting or dynamic CIMOM interaction.
    - Write a config file provider so the CIMOM config can be programatically
      changed from remote.
    - Write an SQL repository.
    - Merge the PollingManager and the SelectEngine to remove a thread.
    - Create a mechanism to share schemas between namespaces.
    - Create a CIM class & provider to control the provider manager (re-scan
      providers, reload/unload providers, register new providers, etc.)
    - Deprecated property providers. Add an option to enable them, but leave
      them disabled by default.  Maybe remove the code in 2.2 (3.0?)
    - Make OW_Cpp*ProviderIFC method virtual (non-pure), so providers don't
      have to override non-implemented methods.
    - Remove instance qualifiers?
    - Create an indication export provider to the logger (cimom logger,
      syslog, etc.)
    - Add some mof compiler options:
      - perform a syntax check (don't really import)
      - delete object(s) from repository
      - Preserve objects (don't overwrite if they already exist)
      - Suppress warnings
      - Suppress all messages.
      - Add -I flag for mof include search path.
      - Specify a file containing a list of MOFs to compile
      - output XML only to stdout.
      - Ignore double #includes so that you don't have to be so careful.
    - Add an option for user to specify which interfaces to listen on.
    - ModifyInstance (deprecate empty PropertyList and ignore includeQualifiers)
    - New advanced errors.
    - Async. methods.
    - Implement new versions of DTD & CIM/XML and support backward 
      compatibility on client & server
    - Support for arrays of references (not currently legal, but there's no
      reason why not)
    - Overriding a method cannot add a required parameter.
    - Deprecate TOINSTANCE (don't send as XML, & ignore on incoming XML)
    - Use libcwd to improve the new segfault handler on linux.  De-mangle names
       and print filename/line numbers.
    - Add a page to the website similar to http://cygwin.com/bugs.html
    - Add rbac authentication
    - Validate the "Required" qualifier on properties during create & modifyInstance.
    - Add config items and code to do ssl client authentication.
    - Config item for slp renewal time.
    - Create a config item so people can use a custom repository.
    - Change ACL checking to use the new CIM access schema

Refactorings:
    - Get rid of all the bool parameters and replace them with enums
      (esp. for cimom handle calls.)
    - Fix ordering of deep and localOnly parameters.
    - Make OW_Exception constructor protected and fix appropriate code.
    - Remove *E functions from the CIMOMHandle.  Create OW_CIMUtils:: functions
      that return OW_Enumeration<T> and OW_Array<T>.
    - Rename OW_Types.h to OW_Types.hpp
    - Put common request handlers into a header (e.g. InstanceArrayBuilder)
    - Rename mof compiler classes to have OW_MOF prefix.
    - XML Things:
      - Split OW_CIMXMLParser into OW_XMLPullParser (generic) and OW_CIMXMLParser (CIM/XML specific)
      - Resurrect the old OW_XMLParser and create OW_XMLSaxParser and OW_XMLDOMParser
      - Move some of the XML code around.  Get rid of param* strings.  Move 
        XMLQualifier::* to XMLCIMFactory.
      - XMLExecute has handling of flags like localonly, etc.  remove this
        and let CIMServer do it.  Remove code from CIMtoXML if not needed. 
      - Fix most of the CIMtoXML object path stuff to closely mirror the dtd.

    Post 3.0
    - Create a base class for all the common code in the provider interfaces.
    - inline the smaller functions in OW_String, OW_StringBuffer, and other 
      commonly used classes.

    Interface breaking, but of questionable value.
    - Clean up naming. Create a CIM class/instance path, local object path,
      etc. and use them where appropriate.
    - Put everything into namespace OpenWBEM and remove OW_
    - Make a new header OW_PPconfig.h that is like OW_config.h now.  Make
      OW_config.h to not use PP symbols, use consts derived from the pp symbols.
    - Rewrite the provider manager lookup so it's simpler/less code.
    - simplify the provider manager lookup structure
    - rename cimom to wbem server
    - Rename OW_NonRecursiveMutex -> OW_Mutex and OW_Mutex -> OW_RecursiveMutex
    - Templatetize/inline the mutex lock classes.
    - Verify that classes maintain their invariant.

Documentation:
    - Enhance developer documentation (similar to "SNIA CIM Object Manager 
      Architecture and Developers Guide" found at 
      http://www.opengroup.org/snia-cimom/) Also see: http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/wmisdk/wmi/supporting_features_for_wmi.asp
    - Document locking from a provider perspective, and which operations are
      safe for providers to perform.  Method providers may run concurrently
      (no locks are held.)
    - Make a web page that has a list of projects/products that are using 
      OpenWBEM.
    - Update javadoc on header files in ifcs, common, client, and provider.
    - Document how to create an SSL key+cert
    - Document each class's:
      - Copy semantics
      - Thread safety
      - Exception safety
    - Define/document invariants for classes (especially OW_CIM*)

Optimizations:
    - Use KCacheGrind to find any hot spots
    - See if using OW_StringBuffer as the OW_String internal representation is 
      faster than ByteBuf.
    - Redo WQL to only process one instance at a time for better scalability.
    - Use OW_HashMap class where appropriate.
    - Change instance/associator provider interface to pass in a list of
      properties which should be returned, so providers can optimize and avoid
      calculating unrequested properties.  OW_CIMServer will have to calculate
      the property list based on local-only, propertyList, deep, etc. Also,
      pass all the parameters (localOnly, deep, propertyList, etc.) to the
      generic *ProviderIFC, so that various interfaces can make use of them.
      Change OW_CIMServer to not do anything with the parameters when calling
      a provider.  Let the provider ifc/provider do all the work.
    - Have OW_CIMClass store a list of base classes.  Then remove some of the
      algorithms that have to run up the chain by doing a repeated getClass.
    - OW_CIMXMLCimomHandle: Only send optional parameters if they aren't the
      default to save transmission bytes.
