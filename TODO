Centralize code for enforcing localOnly, includeClassOrigin,
	includeQualifiers, etc...
Provider interface in a different process.
C provider interface.
Webmin provider(s).
Internationalization.
Deal with locale on WBEM requests.

x Test XML with IPC and Binary with HTTP
x Change C++ Provider IFC to append provider name on factory fuction
x Release Providers from memory if haven't been used for a while
x Remove IPC service and have HTTP service handle UDS
x PKI authentication
x fix make install to symlink libowhttpservice.so to $PREFIX/lib
x Add client SSL authentication
x Unload request handlers if not used after X minutes.



- Binary Indications
- clean up stale indication subscriptions
- smaller schema for make check.  create classes to exercise all aspects of mof and xml.
- various make check components to have separate namespaces.
- long and short versions of make check
- CMPI (replace NPI)

- add handling for new namespace model
x fix OW_CIMServer to throw right exceptions.  OW_CIMServer public
  funcs shouldn't ever return null objects. 
x overhaul Provider interface with consistent const& params. 
- remove __Namespace specific stuff from request handlers.
- handle enumerations differently.
- review CIM operations over HTTP v1.1 and see where we deviate.
  specifically, the indication delivery is known to be different. 
- New model for provider registration .
- fix chuncked output with binary cimomhandle
- XMLExecute has handling of flags like localonly, etc.  remove this
  and let CIMServer do it.  Remove code from CIMtoXML if not needed. 
x fix deleteClass
x search for all reads and writes.  check return values and throw. 
- Create a common base class for client CIMOM handles (OW_CIMXMLCIMOMHandle 
  and OW_BinaryCIMOMHandle) and put common code there (namespace funcs in 
  particular).
