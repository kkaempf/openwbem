x Test XML with IPC and Binary with HTTP
x Change C++ Provider IFC to append provider name on factory fuction
x Release Providers from memory if haven't been used for a while
x Remove IPC service and have HTTP service handle UDS
x PKI authentication
x fix make install to symlink libowhttpservice.so to $PREFIX/lib
x Add client SSL authentication
x Unload request handlers if not used after X minutes.
x fix OW_CIMServer to throw right exceptions.  OW_CIMServer public
  funcs shouldn't ever return null objects. 
x overhaul Provider interface with consistent const& params. 
x handle enumerations differently.
x fix chuncked output with binary cimomhandle
x fix deleteClass
x search for all reads and writes.  check return values and throw. 
x Create a common base class for client CIMOM handles (OW_CIMXMLCIMOMHandle 
  and OW_BinaryCIMOMHandle) and put common code there (namespace funcs in 
  particular).
x simple C++ provider interface. 
x configurable Class cache in meta repository. 
x long and short versions of make check


- Providers/Provider interfaces in a different process.
- Internationalization.
- Deal with locale on WBEM requests.

- Binary Indications
- clean up stale indication subscriptions
- smaller schema for make check.  create classes to exercise all aspects of mof and xml.
- various make check components to have separate namespaces.
- CMPI (replace NPI)

- add handling for new namespace model
- review CIM operations over HTTP v1.1 and see where we deviate.
  specifically, the indication delivery is known to be different. 
- New model for provider registration .
- XMLExecute has handling of flags like localonly, etc.  remove this
  and let CIMServer do it.  Remove code from CIMtoXML if not needed. 

- change XML parser to be lazy. 
- add a test for the matrix on the bottom of
  http://www.dmtf.org/standards/documents/WBEM/DSP200.html#AppendixC
- Make socket write/read also select on shutdown pipe.

fix enumInstances to give back an object path AND an instance.
