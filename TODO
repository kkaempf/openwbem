x Test XML with IPC and Binary with HTTP
x Change C++ Provider IFC to append provider name on factory fuction
x Release Providers from memory if haven't been used for a while
x Remove IPC service and have HTTP service handle UDS
x PKI authentication
x fix make install to symlink libowhttpservice.so to $PREFIX/lib
x Add client SSL authentication
x Unload request handlers if not used after X minutes.
x fix OW_CIMServer to throw right exceptions.  OW_CIMServer public
  funcs shouldn't ever return null objects. 
x overhaul Provider interface with consistent const& params. 
x handle enumerations differently.
x fix chuncked output with binary cimomhandle
x fix deleteClass
x search for all reads and writes.  check return values and throw. 
x Create a common base class for client CIMOM handles (OW_CIMXMLCIMOMHandle 
  and OW_BinaryCIMOMHandle) and put common code there (namespace funcs in 
  particular).
x simple C++ provider interface. 
x configurable Class cache in meta repository. 
x long and short versions of make check
x add a test for the matrix on the bottom of
  http://www.dmtf.org/standards/documents/WBEM/DSP200.html#AppendixC
x change XML parser to be lazy. 
x fix execQuery XML
x pretty-print the XML in the test suites.
x add a test for extrinsic methods with OUT and IN/OUT parameters
x Add executeMethod fail tests to testCIMExceptions
x Add empty() call to OW_String and change all length() == 0 to empty()
x split out namespace parameters to cimom handle calls.
x Intrinsic indications are fetched from root namespace.  Less than optimal.
x Remove any bad NOT_SUPPORTED exceptions.
x Split out the internal provider ifc from the Provider Manager.  
x Fix CIM Server so that an instance provider can provide associations.
x Trailers need to strip newlines from error description.


Testing:
    - smaller schema for make check.  create classes to exercise all aspects 
      of mof and xml.
    - bad xml tests
    - do some interop testing (client-server & server-client)
      - snia old and new (http://www.opengroup.org/snia-cimom/)
      - wbem services (get cimworkshop talking to owcimomd)
      - pegasus
      - openwbem 1.3.2 1.2.x (make sure binary fails)
    - various make check components to have separate namespaces.
    - review CIM operations over HTTP v1.1 and see where we deviate.
      specifically, the indication delivery is known to be different. 
    - Add an instance, property, and associator provider to the test suite.
    - Test case insensitivity (eg. try to add a disk and DISK class)

Fix problems:
    - On startup of UDS if the UDS already exists, SocketImpl need to figure 
      out if someone else is listening. If so, then fail, otherwise delete it.


New features:
    - Providers/Provider interfaces in a different process.
    - Internationalization.
    - Deal with locale on WBEM requests. (at least reject those that won't work)
    - Add better error handling/messages to the MOF compiler.
    - Binary Indications (Possibly re-factor and use CIMXMLListener)
    - clean up stale indication subscriptions (write provider for this)
    - CMPI (replace NPI)
    - Create a mechanism for built-in classes (possibly internal class 
      providers?)
        - add handling for new namespace model
        - New model for provider registration .

Refactorings:
    - Move some of the XML code around.  Get rid of param* strings.  Move 
      XMLQualifier::* to XMLCIMFactory.
    - Create a common base class for C++ provider ifcs (internal, c++, 
      simplec++)
    - inline the smaller functions in OW_String, OW_StringBuffer, and other 
      commonly used classes.
    - XMLExecute has handling of flags like localonly, etc.  remove this
      and let CIMServer do it.  Remove code from CIMtoXML if not needed. 

Documentation:
    - Enhance developer documentation (similar to "SNIA CIM Object Manager 
      Architecture and Developers Guide" found at 
      http://www.opengroup.org/snia-cimom/)

Optimizations:
    - OW_IndicationServerImpl::_processIndication() rewrite (see comment)
    - Switch OW_Reference to be intrusive reference counted.
