Fri Jul 25 11:13:21 MDT 2003
- Fixed 127.0.0.1 in xml of association traversal operations.

Wed Jul 23 12:35:20 MDT 2003
- Added an option to the mof compiler to go directly to the repository.
- Add configure options to disable usage of zlib, pam, ssl, slp, and most
  functional profiles.

Mon Jul 14 15:14:13 MDT 2003
- Wrote a function to read the output of a popened process, and get the
  return code, with a time limit and output limit.

Thu Jun  5 17:24:10 MDT 2003
- Reduced the size binary serlizations.

Wed Jun  4 09:23:06 MDT 2003
- Add binary interface versioning.
- Worked on reducing the size of binary serializations of cim objects.

Fri May 30 09:51:10 MDT 2003
- Added repository versioning.

Wed Apr 30 12:28:32 MDT 2003
- Generalize the class cache in OW_MetaRepository.cpp
- Have the mof compiler use the cache.
- Add handling for new namespace model.  Make namespaces flat instead
    of hierarchial.
- Write a command line utility to register for and print indications.
- Make event system more scalable.
- Implement authorizeFilter, activateFilter, deactivateFilter on providers
- Only parse queries once when they're created.
- Add an option to {dis,en}able the IndicationRepLayer (sending intrinsic
indications.)

Fri Mar 28 12:36:02 MST 2003
- Created a mechanism in the read-write locker to detect simple deadlock,
  the case where one thread acquired a write lock and then later tried
  to acquire a read lock, which would block.

Thu Mar 27 21:28:31 MST 2003
- Created a non-recursive mutex, and use it with condition variables,
- Fixed a bug with the association index.
- Fixed some problems when converting certain object paths to XML.

Mon Feb 10 17:00:23 MST 2003    
- Made it harder to create NULL CIM objects.  Removed the bool constructor
  and add a explicit OW_CIMNULL_t constructor.  (e.g. OW_CIMClass c; won't
  be NULL.  To create a NULL OW_CIMClass, you have to say 
  OW_CIMClass c(OW_CIMNULL);)

Thu Feb  6 10:40:34 MST 2003
- Fixed memory leak in openssl (when restarting).

Tue Jan 21 21:13:49 MST 2003
- Method parameters are optional unless there is a "Required" qualifier.

Tue Jan 21 12:00:35 MST 2003
- Added an option for user to control SO_REUSEADDR

Sun Dec 29 19:27:54 MST 2002
- Wrap OW_*Repository into one class that implements OW_RepositoryIFC.
  Have a way for providers to access it, so they can basically be
  "pass-thru" providers.  They store their instances in the repository,
  but perform operations as the instances are accessed.  The
  CIM_Indication* providers will need this functionality.
  This is also a replacement for property providers.  Instead of property
  providers, an instance provider can be created, which will store parts
  of its instances in the repository and will dynamically add other
  properties.
  - Move handling of flags as low as possible-into {Meta,Inst}Repository
	and providersifc/providers
  - Fix association/reference processing so OW_CIMServer uses
	OW_CIMRepository private _static* methods, to avoid unnecessary
	work.  Maybe create a public interface for this? OW_StaticCIMRepository

Wed Dec 25 11:40:26 MST 2002
- Done: SelectExp classes that event providers can use to easily
  examine queries, and so pre-parsed queries can be stored by
  OW_IndicationServerImpl.
- Write an event Provider interface.  
 
Sun Dec 15 21:10:19 MST 2002
- Added wqlTest2 to the acceptance test suite.

Sat Dec 14 23:17:17 MST 2002
- Changed the WQL lexer to not make all identifiers lower case.
- Made lots of progress and got the new WQL classes working.

Fri Dec 13 23:05:03 MST 2002
- Got the WQL SelectStatement to successfully compile all the test queries.
- Fixed the MOF & WQL lexer to only allocate strings when needed instead of 
  for all tokens.

Wed Dec 11 21:22:12 MST 2002
- Added a warning to the configure.in script that will tell the user that
  they have to edit the config file to not use the PAM authentication
  module if no PAM headers are found.
- Changed wqlTest1.cpp to run queries locally and remotely.

Wed Dec 11 08:29:05 MST 2002
- Created OW_WQLSelectStatementGen which ties into the WQL parser to create
  an OW_WQLSelectStatement.

Tue Dec 10 21:26:33 MST 2002
- Added some WQL classes so indication providers can be effectively 
  implemented. Thanks to Markus Mueller for the code.
- Fixed OW_CIMServer to look for providers for base classes so the new
  provider registration allows a provider to handle all sub-classes.
- Changed the AC_CREATE_PREFIX_CONFIG_H macro to only replace OW_config.h
  if it actually changed.

Wed Dec  4 07:34:42 MST 2002
- Made the locking more granular by creating a rw lock for the schema and
  one for instance data, instead of just one big rw lock.
- Split the association db into a two, one to store class info and one to store
  instance info.  This was to accomodate the finer grained locking.

Tue Dec  3 11:25:46 MST 2002
- Fixed mof compiler wrt default qualifiers (see cim spec 4.7).  Now the CIM
  2.7 schema imports without errors.
- Made string constructors of OW_CIMProperty explicit.
- Finished property provider self-registration.

Sun Dec  1 22:05:05 MST 2002
- Got provider self-registration working for associator and method providers.
- Fleshed out the unit tests for provider self-registration.

Sat Nov 30 11:09:58 MST 2002
- Moved the hash map stuff from OW_MetaRepository.hpp into OW_HashMap.hpp and
  changed OW_ProviderManager to use it.
- Fixed up OW_IndicationServerImpl::_processIndication to be more tolerant of
  non-existent properties or values.

Fri Nov 29 06:53:48 MST 2002
- Fixed the pam module.  Added some code to the acceptance test to make sure
  the daemon will start with the pam module authentication.
- Fixed a bug in OW_COWReference which wasted some memory and caused a crash
  if cast_to was used.
- Reworked the provider manager and interfaces to support provider
  self-registration.  This will facilitate built-in providers and negates the
  need to use the provider qualifier in the schema.
- Split the provider manager initialization into load and init steps.  Now
  it's possible for providers to access the repository during initialization.

Thu Nov 28 11:41:42 MST 2002
- Got rid of OW_ThreadEvent because it is subject to race conditions.
  Replaced it with a condition variable class.
- Create OW_ThreadCounter and use it in OW_HTTPServer, OW_PollingManager and
  OW_IndicationServerImpl.
- Fixed all known startup/shutdown/restart race conditions.

Wed Nov 27 07:13:44 MST 2002
- Redid OW_IndicationServerImpl to use Condition Variables.
- Make OW_AuthManager::init() throw if it can't load an authentication module.

Sun Nov 24 13:50:27 MST 2002
- Run fcntl(fd, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC) on sockets.
- Fixed: Daemon doesn't withstand repeated HUP signals.

Sat Nov 23 10:38:08 MST 2002
- Fixed: On startup of UDS if the UDS already exists, SocketImpl need to figure 
  out if someone else is listening. If so, then fail, otherwise delete it.
  Uses a lock file for coordination with other OpenWBEM cimoms or listeners.
- Fixed: OW_File needs to be more C++ish with a destructor, reasonable copy
  semantics, etc.
- Fixed a race condition in OW_FileSystem::createFile()
- Added OW_FileSystem::openOrCreateFile()
- Fixed a race condition in OW_AssocDb constructor.
- Fixed a race condition in OW_HDB constructor.
- Fixed a race condition in OW_CIMServer::open when creating repository dir.
- Reduced dependencies in some header files.

Fri Nov 22 20:07:54 MST 2002
- Added system file locking support to OW_File.
- Moved OW_File into it's own hpp/cpp files.

Wed Nov 13 14:25:35 MST 2002
- Fixed a bug in _validatePropagatedKeys when the name of the key that the
  Propagated qualifier refered to was different than the name of the
  qualifier's property.

  need to.
- Changed a few places that were using a raw OW_CIMServer pointer to use a
  OW_RepositoryIFCRef instead.
- Fixed compile problem on systems w/out OpenSSL
- Enhancements to the acceptance test suite
- Refactored OW_Reference to use more efficient assembly code instead of
  mutexes for reference counting.
- Created OW_COWReference so there is no need for code to explicitly manage
  COW semantics.
- Refactored OW_Reference and OW_COWReference to have a non-template base
  class to reduce code bloat.
- Changed owmofc to not create XML dump files in /tmp
- Fixed enumInstances in OW_RPM provider.

- handle enumerations differently.
- fix chuncked output with binary cimomhandle
- fix deleteClass
- search for all reads and writes.  check return values and throw.

  and OW_BinaryCIMOMHandle) and put common code there (namespace funcs in 
  particular).
- simple C++ provider interface. 
- configurable Class cache in meta repository. 
- long and short versions of make check
- add a test for the matrix on the bottom of
  http://www.dmtf.org/standards/documents/WBEM/DSP200.html#AppendixC

- fix execQuery XML
- pretty-print the XML in the test suites.
- add a test for extrinsic methods with OUT and IN/OUT parameters
- Add executeMethod fail tests to testCIMExceptions
- Add empty() call to OW_String and change all length() == 0 to empty()
- split out namespace parameters to cimom handle calls.

- Split out the internal provider ifc from the Provider Manager.  
- Fix CIM Server so that an instance provider can provide associations.
- Trailers need to strip newlines from error description.
- Use <asm/atomic.h> operations for reference counting (and reduce header 
  dependencies).

Fri Jan 18 08:00:41 MDT 2002
- Changed the way read/write locks were being handled by the CIMOM. Now only
  one lock is acquired per operation (meaning the provider operates under
  the same lock). Operation should be "completely" atomic now.
 
Wed Jan 16 11:49:00 MDT 2002
- Changed the link line for the executibles on the Linux platforms.
  libpthread is now the first library that links. This fixed a problem with
  threading anomalies on linux.

Mon Jan 14 15:41:00 MDT 2002
- Changed the OW_CIMServer class to contain an OW_CIMClass that 
  represents the namespace class. This class used to be constructed on
  all operations. Now is is only contructed once.

Wed Jan  9 16:25:00 MDT 2002
- Changed the thread yield on the linux pthread implementation. Now it
  calls sched_yield instead of sleep. This makes thing run a bit faster.

Sat Jan  5 14:13:00 MDT 2002
- Made hostname detection more robust

Fri Dec 21 08:17:47 MDT 2001
- Created a new CIMOM handle class call OW_IPCCIMOMHandle. This CIMOM
  handle is designed to be used when connecting to an OpenWBEM CIMOM
  on the local machine. It communicates with the CIMOM over a domain
  socket and doesn't use any XML. All data in the protocol is in its
  binary native format.

Mon Dec 10 10:00:00 MDT 2001
- Fixed problem where domain client connection would through exceptions
  on later versions of the linux kernel. The second parm of the accept
  call was not being set before the call.

Fri Nov  2 15:28:00 MDT 2001
- Rewrote OW_CIMValueCast. Is _MUCH_ smaller now and has the same
  functionality.

- Fixed problem where invoke method on an invalid CIM class would 
  seg-fault the CIMOM.

Mon Oct 22 08:47:00 MDT 2001
- Fixed getProviderProperties/setProviderProperties. It was only looking at
  the overriden properties (oops). changed to call getAllProperties.
  This was found and fixed by Arvind Jain. Thanks Arvind.
 
Mon Oct 15 13:47:00 MDT 2001
- Changed the select mechanism for file/socket handles. Introduced the
  OW_Selectable class. Now things are more generic as far as select is
  concerned.

Thu Oct 11 13:00:00 MDT 2001
- Fixed problem where the localOnly flag was not being passed to the
  instance providers.

Thu Oct 11 12:07:00 MDT 2001
- Changed getInstanceNames to call the instance provider's enumerateInstances
  that returns an OW_CIMObjectPathArray.

Wed Oct  3 15:01:00 MDT 2001
- Added a constructor to OW_CIMDateTime that takes an OW_UInt64 parm that
  will create an interval type of CIM Date time.
- Changed the methods initialize and cleanup on OW_CppProvider to not be
  pure virtual anymore. The implementation of these methods is now
  optional.

Fri Sep 14 13:14:49 MDT 2001
- Expanded the clientDriver to exercise all parameters of the client API.
- Fixed lots of bugs that were discovered by the new tests.

Tue Sep 11 16:10:44 MDT 2001

- Wrote man pages for owcimomd, owexecwql, owmofc, owdigestgenpass

Mon Sep 10 15:48:39 MDT 2001
- added SLP discovery (last week).  This is composed of a polled provider
  and the Client APIs associated with OW_CIMOMLocator and OW_CIMOMInfo.
- (last week)
  Changed provider interface so all methods get a Local CIMOM handle
  passed in.  This allows us to do ACL checking at the provider level,
  as well as on intrinsic methods.
- added a bunch of javadoc style comments to src/net/socket/* and 
  src/http/*

Tue Sep  4 10:40:46 MDT 2001
- changed login/password callback in HTTPClient to be a class, instead
  of a function pointer.

Fri Aug 31 17:37:13 MDT 2001
-  Added owcimomd.enable_deflate option to config file.  (usefull
   to disable it so socket dumps are more meaningfull.  :)

Fri Aug 31 14:55:47 MDT 2001
-  Made the acceptance test script more verbose, especially with 
   failures.
-  Acceptance script looks at OWTESTLIST env. variable to see 
   what tests to perform.
-  Fixed OW_SharedLibrary and OW_SharedLibraryLoader to always
   log to LOG_ERROR dlerror() (if error occurred.)
-  Fixed enumerateQualifiers on RemoteCIMOMHandle. 
-  Enabled SwitchToSymlinks in acceptance tests, so all libs and 
   binaries point to build dir.
-  Added chmod +x to .so build rule in Makefiles.
-  Fixed handling of qualifiers on CIM Instances. 

Wed Aug 29 11:07:30 MDT 2001

   and to make a tarball of the results.
-  No longer run HTTPS test if not built with SSL

Tue Aug 28 15:57:41 MDT 2001
-  Added acinclude.m4 with AC_CREATE_PREFIX_CONFIG_H, TYPE_SOCKLEN_T,
   and others.  (http://www.gnu.org/software/ac-archive/)
-  Prefixed all upper-case #defines in OW_config.h with OW_ so we
   won't conflict with other automake/autoconf projects.
-  Changed OW_InetSSLSocketImpl::OW_InetSSLSocketImpl(fd) to 
   throw exceptions again (but to free up memory first).

Fri Aug 24 15:05:03 MDT 2001
-  Fixed deflate compression when used without chunking/trailers support.

Thu Aug 23 16:54:52 MDT 2001
-  Fixed configure.in to define HAVE_ZLIB_H

-  Fixed password prompt on mof compiler and owexecwql to only
   ask for password once.  
-  switched /etc/pam.d/openwbem to use pam_unix instead of pam_pwdb
   (SuSE doesn't have pam_pwdb, but OL and RH have pam_unix.

Wed Aug 22 15:13:20 MDT 2001
-  Fixed OW_InetSSLSocketImpl.cpp to not throw exceptions in it's
   ctor.  (gcc is buggy and doesn't delete it like it should)
-  Fixed HTTP Server to always eat entity, even if sending a 4XX
   response.  See rfc 2616 Section 10.4
-  Made the HTTPClient retry only three times, not forever.

-  Fixed WQL wrt setting a string data type to "" or null.


Fri Aug 17 11:42:58 MDT 2001
-  Discovered the -fno_default_inline compiler option.  We now work
   with -O3 -fno_default_inline.
-  Changed RestartDaemon in acceptance.sh back to do a HUP.

-  changed hostname stuff in acceptance.sh
-  changed RestartDaemon in acceptance.sh to do a StopDaemon; StartDaemon.
-  slight change in OW_CIMServer::execQuery in an attempt to fix with -O3
   (didn't work)

Thu Aug 16 12:00:55 MDT 2001
-  Changed OW_CIMServer so that providers always get a CIMOMHandle 
   with an "internal" ACLInfo.
-  Changed Instance repository to use the namespace as part of the db
   key.  NOTE: previous repositories are now incompatible.
-  enabled ACL test in acceptance.sh.
-  Added get/set property test to clientdriver.  (they work).

Wed Aug 15 17:52:58 MDT 2001
-  Added ACL test suite.
-  Changed behavior of ACLs WRT namespaces.  Subnamespaces now inherit
   the ACLs of their parents if no user or namespace ACLs are found. 
-  Made OW_CIMObjectPath and OW_CIMValue ctors explicit.
-  Fixed lots of bugs flushed out by the above change.
-  Fixed setProperty in OW_CIMServer. (I think getProperty is still broken)
-  Changed enumNameSpace on OW_RemoteCIMOMHandle to use enumInstanceNames.
-  Fixed a bug where the check for __Namespace was case sensitive.
-  Fixed indications to be able to handle instances from namespaces 
   other than /root.

-  Renamed concrete authentication modules to reflect the above change.
-  Changed the doAuthenticate() function on OW_Authenticator (and 
   concreate classes) to take a third argument: OW_String& username.
   Modules should assign the username to this variable so that it 
   can be made known to ACLMgr.

-  Removed libtool from the build process. 
-  Fixed a problem with array properties.
-  Ported to Solaris 2.8.

   cooperative thread library. The gnu pth library can be
   used instead of pthreads with a command line option to
   configure.
-  Ported to OpenServer (OSR5). This port uses the gnu pth
   cooperative thread library.
-  Ported to UnixWare 7 and OpenUnix 8.

   interface.  This replaces the getSignature() function in previous versions.

Fri July 20 2001	Realease of 1.1.0

Many great changes and fixes in this release. Memory leaks seem to be
non-existent ;-). Many seg-faults and threading problems have been fixed.
Great wql and indication support. Associations work great now....

-  Fixed a problem in the Digest Authentication module with reguard to 
   the nonce count being used in the hash computation.
-  Fixed a threading issue where the CIMProduct IFC (used by http server)
   wasn't being cloned for each connection. 
-  Fixed a buffer overrun in OW_HTTPLenLimitIStream.
-  Added deflate compression support to HTTP Server/Client.
-  Changed repository interface to support getInstanceNames and enumClassnames.
   Implemented these methods in OW_CIMServer.
-  Many bug fixes done in association handling. Association handling seems to
   be working across the board.
-  Changed OW_MutexLock so it does not depend on OW_Reference and is no longer
   ref counted. Eleminated need for dynamic allocation.
-  WQL Level 2 implemented as a loadable shared library that can be used by
   either the client or server.  
-  WQL test suite implemented.
-  Indication support implemented.
-  Created Trigger providers, that can trigger indications.
-  Created Indication delivery providers that will be called by the cimom to
   deliver indications.
-  Rewrote OW_Reference use less memory and be more efficient.
-  Moved copy constructor of OW_XMLNode into the cpp file.
-  Made the unitTest run from a script so that the LD_LIBRARY_PATH could
   be set, and the test would run even if the system didn't have all the
   openwbem libraries in the /etc/ld.so.conf.
-  Removed code from OW_NwIface.cpp that figures out the MAC address of a nic
   card, because we never use it and it very hard to port.
-  Started porting to solaris 2.8, but not finished yet.  Initial code is in
   the CVS repository, it compiles, but doesn't work yet.
-  Started porting to UnixWare (OpenUnix).  Not yet complete.
-  Moved gdbindexer.cpp to OW_IndexImpl.cpp, since it doesn't have to be
   under the OS abstraction layer anymore.
-  Integrated libdb into the distribution, since the exact version we want is
   probably not on many platforms, except linux, and even then different
   distributions have different names for the header files and libraries.
-  Changed constructor of OW_RandomNumber to only seed the rng once.
-  Fixed a few bugs in the indexer to work with our custom libdb.
-  Fixed a problem in OW_HDBNode::add where it didn't check the return value of
   adding an index entry.
-  Some adjustments to the unit test suite to compile correctly when memory
   checking was enabled.
-  Several improvements to OW_MemTracer.  Environment variables 
   OW_MEM_NOFREE and OW_MEM_AGGRESSIVE can be set to customize the 
   degree of memory debugging.  OW_MemTracer now does bounds checking
   (for overruns and underruns).
-  Fixed threading problems in OW_MemTracer.
-  Fixed a memory leak in OW_HTTPChunkerTestCases.cpp.
-  Fixed a bunch of memory leaks in mofparser.ypp.
-  Added a mutex guard in OW_Environment::getWQLRef.
-  Fixed a race condition when shutting down in cimListenerTest.cpp.
-  Added a shutdownHttpServer method to OW_HTTPXMLCIMListener.
-  Removed OW_config.h from the CVS repository. Made it so that config.h no 
   longer exists, it gets copied to OW_config.h, and OW_config.h no longer
   #include's config.h.  This way our config.h won't conflict with another
   project's config.h, if our headers are installed on the system and it uses
   openwbem's headers.
-  Tweaks to the code to get it to compile w/out warnings on egcs 2.91
-  Define _REENTRANT in OW_config.h
-  Created 2 test trigger providers that are used by the indication test suite.
-  Improved some error messages in OW_XMLExecute.cpp
-  Added default constructor for OW_URL
-  Split up OW_Types.h into OW_NetworkTypes.hpp, OW_ThreadTypes.hpp and 
   OW_ByteSwap.hpp.  This significantly reduced header dependencies and thus
   reduced compile time by quite a bit.
-  Added configure script checks for byte order, and native type size.
-  Added an stl friendly interface to OW_Enumeration and OW_Array.
-  Reduced header dependencies in OW_CIM*.hpp files.  Now you can simply
   include the appropriate CIM header instaead of having to get them all by
   include OW_CIM.hpp.
-  Fixed a bug in OW_HTTPSvrConnection where the cimom segfaulted when the
   client was killed in the middle of doing something.
-  Fixed a segfault in OW_CIMServer that was caused when deleteInstance was
   called with a CIMObjectPath without a classname in it.
-  Added a log message to OW_MetaRepository to indicate which repository was
   opened.
-  Changed constructors of OW_Format to pass parameters by reference instead of
   by value.
-  Fixed spelling problems with throw messages in OW_Array.
-  Added comparison operators on OW_CIMValue.
-  Added an operator< for OW_Array so it could be used by OW_CIMValue.
-  Added explicit to the OW_Reference constructor so it wouldn't accidentally
   take ownership of a pointer.
-  Fixed a problem in the mof compiler when checking array sizes.
-  Fixed a bug in OW_String::isSpaces.
-  Optimized OW_String::erase.
-  Started working on making things more compliant with the c++ standard, so
   it would compile on gcc 3.0.
-  Switched OW_String to use a NULL m_buf instead of g_emptyBuf, because of
   undefined c++ static initialization order.
-  Changed some of the static variables in OW_Environment to be pointers that
   get initialized when init() is called, so that there would be less problems
   with static initialization order.
-  Fix to mof compiler: 64-bit integers are now fully supported.
-  Code has been added to OW_MetaRepository to not allow a class to declare
   key properties that are not contained in it's parent class.
-  Code has been added to OW_MetaRepository to not allow an association class
   to be derived from a non-association class.
-  No longer allow a class to be created that is not an indication or
   an abstract class without key properties.
-  Added rudimentary lru cache to class OW_MetaRepository.
-  New associations and references code.
   Checking referential integrity on propagated keys in OW_CIMServer.

-  Changed read/write locking algorithm to be more thread safe.
-  Changed our reference counting mechanism to return OW_MutexLocks when
   acquiring write locks for copy on write objects.
-  Added temporary implementation of WQL level 2 to support the current
   development on indications. This will be replaced by a better WQL
   implementation in a couple of weeks.
-  The execQuery api is implemented on the client and server side. The
   query is executed on the server side.
-  Fixed digest authentication in HTTP client and made improvements to digest
   authentication module.
-  Added the CIM product: CIM Listener. This is available in the client
   library (beware. WQL implementation is a little flaky right now).
-  Changed the generic provider interface that is used by OW_CIMServer. It no
   longer has the methods for init and cleanup. These are appropriately handled
   by the individual provider interfaces. Consequently the C++ provider
   interface was changed to include these methods on it's generic provider
   interface.
-  Added support for indications (this is currently disabled until the next
   release).
-  Added index file support for associations (this is currently disabled until
   the next release).
-  Fixed various bugs in the MOF compiler.
-  Fixed various bugs in OW_InetAddress.
-  Changed OW_Index back to use libdb. The old indexing didn't support
   unlimited key lengths.
-  Fixed various segfault problems in OW_XMLNode.
-  Fixed	various segfault problems in the OW_CIM classes.
-  Fixed problems with OW_CIMValue when it contained a REFERENCE datatype.
-  Fixed OW_CIMObjectPath::toString and parse. The parse method was not
   working at all before.
-  Fixed various segfault problems in OW_CIM classes.
-  Created test programs for WQL.
-  Create test programs for indications and CIMListener.
-  Fixed various bugs in the code since the last release that we can't remember
   right now (sorry. We'll do better next time :-( ).


Fri May 18 15:02:09 MDT 2001

- Changed provider interface and c++provider shared library interface 
  to return version of CIMOM they were compiled with to detect 
  incompatibilities.
- Changed OW_Index to use I/O framework from libopenwbem.
- Fixed digest authentication on HTTP Server (client still broken)
  and added a tool (owdigestgenpass) to create a MD5 password file.
- Added an acceptance test script to make check.
- Added support for Multiple Operations (MULTIREQ and MULTIRSP) to owcimomd.
- Fixed filename generation problem in OW_HDB and OW_Index.
- Fixed bug in mof compiler when user specifies an invalid filename. 
- Updated mof compiler to comply with CIM Specification addendum #2.
- Fixed a problem in the authentication modules when empty base64 
  credentials are given. 
- Other bug fixes...
