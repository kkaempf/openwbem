<a NAME="q3"></a><h3>What do I need to build OpenWBEM?</h3>
<blockquote>
To build OpenWBEM, you need gcc version 2.91.66 or higher,
GNU make, and flex. &nbsp;Note that
you currently can't use gcc 3.x due to some problems that gcc 3.x has
with iostreams. &nbsp;On OSR5, you will also need the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/pth/">GNU pth </a>
cooperative thread library. &nbsp;Optionally, you may also want
<a href="http://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a> if you want to support 
HTTPS, and <a href="http://www.gzip.org/zlib/">zlib</a> if you want to 
support zlib (deflate) compression.

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<a NAME="q1"></a><h3>How do I link a binary to the OpenWBEM libraries?</h3>
<blockquote>
All applications using OpenWBEM will need to link with libopenwbem.so.  
This is accomplished by adding <tt>-lopenwbem</tt> to your link flags. &nbsp;
In addition, you may need some of the following flags, depending on how
OpenWBEM was built.
<blockquote>
<li><tt>-lssl -lcrypto</tt> if OpenWBEM was built with OpenSSL.</li>
<li><tt>-lz</tt> if OpenWBEM was built with zlib.</li>
<li><tt>-lpthread</tt> if OpenWBEM was built with pthreads. &nbsp;This should 
be done on Linux only. &nbsp;On Unixware/OpenUnix, add <tt>-pthread</tt> to 
both the compile and link flags. &nbsp;On Solaris, add <tt>-pthreads</tt>
to both the compile and link flags.</li>
<li><tt>-lpth</tt> if OpenWBEM was built with the GNU pth library (OSR5)</li>
<li><tt>-lsocket -lnsl</tt> if building on Solaris.</li>
<li><tt>-lsocket</tt> if building on UnixWare/OpenUnix</li>
</blockquote>
This should be all that is needed
for a program utilizing the OpenWBEM client API.
<p>
If your program needs to use the server components of OpenWBEM
(i.e. you are writing a provider or an authentication module), you 
need to add the following link flags: <tt>-lowserver -lowdb</tt>.
<p>
If you are writing an application that uses the OpenWBEM mof compiler
library, add <tt>-lowmofc</tt> to your link flags.

<a NAME="q2"></a><h3>make check failed.&nbsp; What do I do now?</h3>
<blockquote>
If the acceptance test script failed, there are several log files
which may help you determine what went wrong. &nbsp;The acceptance
script installs OpenWBEM in test/acceptance/stage. &nbsp;The directory
test/acceptance/stage/results contains the output from the various
tests performed by the acceptance test script. &nbsp;You might start with
owcimomd.output. &nbsp;You can also look in test/acceptance/stage for 
core files. &nbsp;If you are familiar with gdb, please create a backtrace
from the core file(s) and email it to <a href="mailto:openwbem-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">openwbem-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.
</blockquote>
<p>
<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<a NAME="q4"></a><h3>Why can't I authenticate using Linux-PAM authentication?</h3>
<blockquote>
Make sure you have a /etc/pam.d/openwbem file that works. &nbsp;You should
be able to copy the one from etc/pam.d/ in the source tar file. &nbsp;Also,
make sure you are authenticating as a user listed in the pam.allowed_users
variable in openwbem.conf. &nbsp;For additional information, see the file
AuthModule.HOWTO in the source tar file.
</blockquote>
<p>
<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<a NAME="q5"></a><h3>Why doesn't the configure script detect OpenSSL?</h3>
<blockquote>
The configure script will look in the following places the the OpenSSL headers and libraries: <tt>/usr/local/openssl /usr/lib/openssl /usr/local/ssl /usr/lib/ssl /usr/local /usr/pkg /opt /opt/openssl</tt>
If you have installed OpenSSL in another directory, then you must use the --with-ssl-dir switch to 
specify the path to the OpenSSL "installation", not the headers.
This should be the directory containing <tt>./include</tt> and <tt>./lib</tt>.
If you installed OpenSSL from the source tarball distribution, the default location is <tt>/usr/local/ssl</tt>, and should be found automatically.
<br>
If OpenSSL is installed in one of the locations listed above, and the configure script is not finding it, then most likely you don't have the OpenSSL library directory in your <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>.  If OpenSSL is installed in <tt>/usr/local/ssl</tt>, then <tt>/usr/local/ssl/lib</tt> must be in your <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>.  configure tries to
compile and run a small ssl program.  If the program doesn't run, then the configure script will not detect OpenSSL.
With <tt>/usr/local/ssl/lib</tt> in your <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>,
the small test program should work, and configure will "find"
OpenSSL in <tt>/usr/local/ssl</tt> automatically.

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<a NAME="q6"></a><h3>How do I build from OpenWBEM from CVS?</h3>
<blockquote>
First run the cvsbootstrap.sh script, which will generate the Makefile.in files and the configure script.  You must have autoconf and automake installed for this to work.  Then you can run configure and finally make.
