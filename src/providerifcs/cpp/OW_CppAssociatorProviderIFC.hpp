		 * This method is invoked in order to do the Associators operation as

		 * http://www.dmtf.org/download/spec/xmls/CIM_HTTP_Mapping10.htm#SecAssociators
		 * This operation is used to enumerate CIM
		 * Instances that are associated to a particular source CIM Object.
		 *
		 * @param assocClass Defines the association that the objectName
		 * 	object should be associated to. The provider uses this
		 * 	information to identify which association must be
		 * 	traversed in case it supports more than one
		 * 	association.
		 *
		 * @param objectName Defines the source CIM Object whose associated
		 * 	Objects are to be returned.  This is an instance name.
		 * 	Instance name (modelpath).
		 *
		 * @param resultClass The resultClass input parameter, if not empty (""),
		 * 	MUST be a valid CIM Class name.  It acts as a filter on the
		 * 	returned set of Objects by mandating that each returned Object
		 * 	MUST be either an Instance of this Class (or one of its subclasses)
		 * 	or be this Class (or one of its subclasses).
		 *
		 * @param role The role input parameter, if not empty (""), MUST be a
		 * 	valid Property name.  It acts as a filter on the returned set of
		 * 	Objects by mandating that each returned Object MUST be associated
		 * 	to the source Object via an Association in which the source Object
		 * 	plays the specified role (i.e. the name of the Property in the
		 * 	Association Class that refers to the source Object MUST match the
		 * 	value of this parameter).
		 *
		 * @param resultRole The resultRole input parameter if not empty (""),
		 * 	MUST be a valid Property name.  It acts as a filter on the returned
		 * 	set of Objects by mandating that each returned Object MUST be
		 * 	associated to the source Object via an Association in which the
		 * 	returned Object plays the specified role (i.e. the name of the
		 * 	Property in the Association Class that refers to the returned
		 * 	Object MUST match the value of this parameter).
		 *
		 * @param includeQualifiers If the includeQualifiers input parameter
		 * 	is true this specifies that all Qualifiers for each Object
		 * 	(including Qualifiers on the Object and on any returned Properties)
		 * 	MUST be included as elements in the response.   If false no
		 * 	elements are present in each returned Object.
		 *
		 * @param includeClassOrigin If the includeClassOrigin input parameter
		 * 	is true, this specifies that the CLASSORIGIN attribute MUST be
		 * 	present on all appropriate elements in each returned Object. If
		 * 	false, no CLASSORIGIN attributes are present in each returned
		 * 	Object.
		 *
		 * @param propertyList If the propertyList input parameter is not NULL
		 * 	the members of the array define one or more Property names.
		 * 	Each returned Object MUST NOT include elements for any Properties
		 * 	missing from this list.  Note that if localOnly is specified as
		 * 	true (or deepInheritance is specified as false) this acts as an
		 * 	additional filter on the set or Properties returned (for example,
		 * 	if Property A is included in the propertyList but localOnly is set
		 * 	to true and A is not local to a returned Instance, then it will
		 * 	not be included in that Instance).  If the propertyList input
		 * 	parameter is an empty array this signifies that no Properties are
		 * 	included in each returned Object.  If the propertyList parameter
		 * 	is omitted this specifies that all Properties (subject to the
		 * 	conditions expressed by the other parameters) are included in each
		 * 	returned Object.  If the propertyList contains duplicate elements,
		 * 	the Server ignores the duplicates but otherwise processes the
		 * 	request normally.  If the propertyList contains elements which are
		 * 	invalid Property names for any target Object, the Server ignores
		 * 	such entries but should otherwise process the request normally.
		 * 	Clients SHOULD NOT explicitly specify properties in the propertyList
		 * 	parameter unless they have specified a non-empty value for the
		 * 	resultClass parameter.
		 *
		 * @returns If successful, the method returns zero or more CIM Instances
		 * 	meeting the requested criteria.
		 *
		 * @throws CIMException. - The following IDs can be expected.
		 * 	CIM_ERR_ACCESS_DENIED
		 * 	CIM_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED
		 * 	CIM_ERR_INVALID_NAMESPACE
		 * 	CIM_ERR_INVALID_PARAMETER (including missing, duplicate,
		 * 	unrecognized or otherwise incorrect parameters)
		 * 	CIM_ERR_FAILED (some other unspecifed error occurred)
