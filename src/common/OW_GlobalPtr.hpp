	 * This class can be used to store a global pointer. The pointer is lazily constructed. The pointer is
	 * never deleted. The intended use is for objects which must always exist for the lifetime of a program, but
	 * which may need to be polymorphic and replaced to enable plugging in a mock object for testing.
	 * 
	 * GlobalPtr is a POD type, and thus must be initialized using POD initialization syntax:
	 *   GlobalPtr<myType> myGlobalPtr = OW_GLOBAL_PTR_INIT;
	 * 
	 * The pointer will be lazily constructed. The first time get() is called, a new T (or derived) will be
	 * instantiated by a call to FactoryT::create(). The default type for FactoryT allocates a new instance of T
	 * using the default constructor. The initialization is done in a thread safe manner. The double checked
	 * locking pattern is used, which doesn't have a large overhead.
	 * 
	 * The object will never be deleted, so if the destructor needs to do meaningful work, this class shouldn't be
	 * used.
	 * 
	 * All calls to get() are thread safe.
	 * Calls to set() are not thread safe.
	 * 
	 * @param T The type of the pointer.
	 * @param FactoryT To create the T*, FactoryT::create() will be called with no parameters. The return type
	 *                 must be convertible to a T*. The default will return a new T using the default constructor.
